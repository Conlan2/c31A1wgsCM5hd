        <h3 id="Barrel Title">Do a Barrel Roll</h3>
    <p>If a user types in the words "do a barrel roll" into google will cause<br>
    the page to spin around the page. This  is not a barrel roll if you are being technical<br>
        it is actually an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileron_roll">aileron roll.</a> </p>

        <h3 id="Google Gravity Title">Google Gravity</h3>
    <p>This is an easter egg that sadly no longer exists on google proper and now can only be found <br>
        on other websites such as seen <a href="https://mrdoob.com/projects/chromeexperiments/google-gravity/">here.</a>
    All the pieces move around like they are affected by gravity. <br> This page is actually rather nostalgic as it
    uses the google logo and UI like they were many years ago</p>

       <h3 id="Awesome Youtube Title">Awesome youtube</h3>
    <p>While not technically part of google proper, youtube is owned by the google corporation so it technically counts. <br>
        If you type the characters "a,w,e,s,o,m,e" while a youtube video is running, any red colour used in the <br>
        in the styling will flash rainbow colours.
