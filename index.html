    <h1 id="Web Title">Wacky Google Facts</h1>
    <p>Google contains some secrets if you know were to look (or what to type)<br>
    This site will show some cool google factoids such as the legendary <a href="#Barrel Title">Barrel Roll</a>
     </p>

    <h3 id="Barrel Title">Do a Barrel Roll</h3>
    <p>If a user types in the words "do a barrel roll" into google will cause<br>
    the page to spin around the page. This  is not a barrel roll if you are being technical<br>
        it is actually an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileron_roll">aileron roll.</a> </p>

    <h3 id="Section Title">Google</h3>
    <p>This is an easter egg that sadly no longer exists on google proper and now can only be found <br>
        on other websites such as seen <a href="https://mrdoob.com/projects/chromeexperiments/google-gravity/">here.</a>
    All the peices move around like they are affected by gravity. <br> This page is actaually rather nostaligic as it
    uses the google logo and UI like they were many years ago</p>
